DEBUGGING IN c

This directory is to practice debugging in c programming. This is an educational study designed by alx to help learn debugging.
This study comes with three projects to help undestand debugging to the fullest.

In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within computer programs, software, or systems.

Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling. Many programming languages and software development tools also offer programs to aid in debugging, known as debuggers.
